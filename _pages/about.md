Welcome to the **Deep MicroVision Lab** at Beijing Institute of Technology.

The Deep MicroVision Lab develops theoretical foundations and computational methods for next-generation microscopy and imaging systems.

Our research integrates signal processing, machine learning, and computational imaging to address fundamental challenges in high-resolution imaging under extreme noise and limited measurements.

## Research Areas

### Cryo-Electron Microscopy
Phase retrieval and reconstruction under low-dose imaging conditions.

### Computational Microscopy
Lens-free imaging and computational phase imaging.

### Inverse Problems and Learning
Physics-informed deep learning and optimization methods.

### Imaging under Low-Dose Conditions
Algorithms for photon-limited and noisy imaging.

## Join Us
